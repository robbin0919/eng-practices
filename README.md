# Google Engineering Practices Documentation

Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and
all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various
best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source
projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to
make it available publicly when possible.

Google 有許多通用的工程實踐，涵蓋所有語言和所有專案。這些文件代表了我們長期以來發展的各種最佳實踐的集體經驗。開源專案或其他組織可能會從這些知識中受益，因此我們努力在可能的情況下將其公開

Currently this contains the following documents:

目前包含以下文件：

*   [Google's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two
    separate sets of documents(實際上是由兩個獨立的文件組成):
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)

## Terminology

There is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here for external readers:

其中一些文件中使用了一些 Google 內部術語，我們在此為外部讀者進行澄清：

*   **CL**: Stands for "changelist", which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change", "patch", or "pull-request".
    
    **CL**: 代表 “changelist”，這表示已提交給版本控製或正在接受程式碼審查的一項獨立修改。其他組織通常稱之為 “change”、”patch” 或 “pull-request”。
    
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a CL.
    
    **LGTM**: 意思是 "Looks Good to Me"(我覺得不錯). 這是code reviewer 在批准 CL 時所說的話。
