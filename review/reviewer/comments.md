# How to write code review comments ( 如何撰寫 code review 評論 )



## Summary ( 摘要  )

-   Be kind.( 友善一點。 )
-   Explain your reasoning. ( 解釋你的推理、理由 )
-   Balance giving explicit directions with just pointing out problems and
    letting the developer decide. ( 在給予明確指示與僅指出問題並讓開發人員決定之間取得平衡。 )
-   Encourage developers to simplify code or add code comments instead of just
    explaining the complexity to you. ( 鼓勵開發人員簡化程式碼或添加程式碼註釋，而不是僅僅向您解釋複雜性。 )

## Courtesy ( 禮貌 )

In general, it is important to be
[courteous and respectful](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/cr_respect.md)
while also being very clear and helpful to the developer whose code you are
reviewing. One way to do this is to be sure that you are always making comments
about the *code* and never making comments about the *developer*. You don't
always have to follow this practice, but you should definitely use it when
saying something that might otherwise be upsetting or contentious. For example:

一般而言，在審查他人的程式碼時，保持禮貌和尊重，同時也要清楚、有幫助地向開發人員提供意見是很重要的。 一種實現這一點的方法是確保您的評論始終針對程式碼本身，而不是針對開發人員。您不一定總是需要遵循這個做法，但當您要說一些可能引起不悅或爭議的話時，絕對應該使用這種方式。例如：


Bad: "Why did **you** use threads here when there's obviously no benefit to be
gained from concurrency?"

不佳的範例： "你為什麼要在這裡使用線程？顯然從concurrency（並發性）中得不到任何好處。"

Good: "The concurrency model here is adding complexity to the system without any
actual performance benefit that I can see. Because there's no performance
benefit, it's best for this code to be single-threaded instead of using multiple
threads."

較佳的範例： "目前的concurrency（並發性）模型增加了系統的複雜性，但卻沒有看到任何實際的性能提升。由於沒有性能優勢，因此最好將此程式碼改為單線程，而不是使用多個線程。"

筆記：

更委婉: "在這個情況下使用線程似乎沒有帶來任何並發性的優勢，您能否說明一下這樣設計的原因呢?"

解釋:

這個句子直接指責開發人員使用了不必要的線程，可能會引起開發人員的不悅。
更委婉的翻譯則以疑問的方式提出，更加尊重開發人員的專業判斷，同時也表達了對程式碼設計的疑問。

建議:

在程式碼審查過程中，儘量使用委婉、建設性的語言，避免直接指責或批評開發人員。
 

## Explain Why ( 解釋為什麼 ) {#why}

One thing you'll notice about the "good" example from above is that it helps the
developer understand *why* you are making your comment. You don't always need to
include this information in your review comments, but sometimes it's appropriate
to give a bit more explanation around your intent, the best practice you're
following, or how your suggestion improves code health.

## Giving Guidance ( 給予引導 ) {#guidance}

**In general it is the developer's responsibility to fix a CL, not the
reviewer's.** You are not required to do detailed design of a solution or write
code for the developer.

This doesn't mean the reviewer should be unhelpful, though. In general you
should strike an appropriate balance between pointing out problems and providing
direct guidance. Pointing out problems and letting the developer make a decision
often helps the developer learn, and makes it easier to do code reviews. It also
can result in a better solution, because the developer is closer to the code
than the reviewer is.

However, sometimes direct instructions, suggestions, or even code are more
helpful. The primary goal of code review is to get the best CL possible. A
secondary goal is improving the skills of developers so that they require less
and less review over time.

Remember that people learn from reinforcement of what they are doing well and
not just what they could do better. If you see things you like in the CL,
comment on those too! Examples: developer cleaned up a messy algorithm, added
exemplary test coverage, or you as the reviewer learned something from the CL.
Just as with all comments, include [why](#why) you liked something, further
encouraging the developer to continue good practices.

## Label comment severity ( 標籤評論嚴重性 ) {#label-comment-severity}

Consider labeling the severity of your comments, differentiating required
changes from guidelines or suggestions.

Here are some examples:

> Nit: This is a minor thing. Technically you should do it, but it won’t hugely
> impact things.
>
> Optional (or Consider): I think this may be a good idea, but it’s not strictly
> required.
>
> FYI: I don’t expect you to do this in this CL, but you may find this
> interesting to think about for the future.

This makes review intent explicit and helps authors prioritize the importance of
various comments. It also helps avoid misunderstandings; for example, without
comment labels, authors may interpret all comments as mandatory, even if some
comments are merely intended to be informational or optional.

## Accepting Explanations ( 接受解釋 ) {#explanations}

If you ask a developer to explain a piece of code that you don't understand,
that should usually result in them **rewriting the code more clearly**.
Occasionally, adding a comment in the code is also an appropriate response, as
long as it's not just explaining overly complex code.

**Explanations written only in the code review tool are not helpful to future
code readers.** They are acceptable only in a few circumstances, such as when
you are reviewing an area you are not very familiar with and the developer
explains something that normal readers of the code would have already known.
